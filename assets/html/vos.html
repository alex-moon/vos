                VOS started life as a side project, for fun, driven by a desire
                to do a walk of the planets, starting at the sun, with the
                planets to scale relative to the sun being one meter wide.
            </p>

                Having researched the respective sizes and distances, Alex was
                inclined to wonder what a second walk, scaled down 10,000 times,
                would look like; and how many such walks one would do before
                hitting the end of the observable universe.

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Alex found calculating these walks by hand tedious and prone to
        human error, so, naturally, he did what any software engineer in
        his position would: he wrote an app.
