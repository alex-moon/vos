                Alex grew up in Canberra, Australia. His professional career
                started at the Australian Demographics and Social Research
                Institute at the Australian National University. He worked
                for a number of tech businesses in Canberra and Melbourne until
                2012, when he moved to London.

        In 2015, seeking a more Canberra-sized city, he moved to
        Newcastle upon Tyne, and then, in 2021, to Gateshead, where
        he now resides. As well as writing code for fun and profit, he
        makes music in his spare time.
