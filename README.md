Vastness of Space
=================

For CLI:
```
php vos.php sun 1 m
```

The output is a list of celestial objects and their respective sizes scaled
relative to the target input, i.e. "if the sun were 1m wide" in the example.

For Web:
```
./run.sh
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser. Have fun!
